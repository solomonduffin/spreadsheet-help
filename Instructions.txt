SPECIAL FUNCTIONALITY: Row-wise and column-wise cell aggregation.
  - Our spreadsheet application provides the ability to perform row-wise and column-wise addition, multiplication, and averaging across cells. 
  - To sum over a range enter “=SUM(START_OF_RANGE:END_OF_RANGE)”.
  - To multiply over a range enter “=MULT(START_OF_RANGE:END_OF_RANGE)”.
  - To calculate average over a range enter “=AVG(START_OF_RANGE:END_OF_RANGE)”.
  - For example, if we wish to perform row-wise summation from cell A1 to cell F1 you would 
    enter “=SUM(A1:F1)” into the content box. The spreadsheet application will then perform 
    addition over the cells in the range. Similarly, for column-wise summation from cell A1 
    to A5 you would enter “=SUM(A1:A5)” into the content box. 
  - Lowercase function calls are also allowed: =sum, =mult, =avg.
    *No additional white-spaces are allowed within the call, but whitespace before and after is fine.
